## What we’re after…
Anything! Fiction, non-fiction, art, illustrations, animations, short films, music, photography…the list goes on. If it’s your own work and you’d like to share it with the world, we’re interested! We’re also happy to host work that has previously been hosted elsewhere - just make sure to let us know where it’s already been featured!

## How and what…
All submissions should be sent to itsswingsandroundabouts@outlook.com.

Make sure to include a short bio along with your submissions, as well as any links to wider work and social media you’d like to include. Fear not, self-promotion doesn’t make you Kanye West!

## Rules of the playground…
These are your rights as a contributing artist. Make sure you read them.

Having submitted, you retain all copyright in your work. By submitting, and therefore agreeing to our terms, you grant Swings & Roundabouts permission to publish your work on www.itsswingsandroundabouts.co.uk and promote the work via Swings & Roundabouts’ social channels.

We are currently an online-only publishing platform. In the future we may look to publish some content in print. If and when this becomes the case, we will contact you to secure the rights and permission to publish your work.

Your work may be edited prior to publication online. If we deem that edits are necessary, it will be sent to you for review and approval.

By submitting, you agree to let Swings & Roundabouts make decisions on how your submitted work is displayed, formatted and promoted. This agreement also grants us the permission to use your name (or artist name) and work in marketing and promotional activity for Swings & Roundabouts.

**We haven't monetised this blog, so we're working on a please be free basis. The second we come into money, we'll share the love**

By submitting, you declare that you are the sole owner of the material. The material submitted therefore must not infringe the copyright or licensing rights of any other party. Plagiarism will NOT be tolerated. Any material that is deemed to be an infringement of another party’s copyright or licensing rights will be removed immediately. You also agree to compensate Swings & Roundabouts for any loss or damages incurred due to a breach of these rights.

Wow, thank God that bit’s over…
